## Inbound traffic versus outbound traffic

![alt text](/img/image-25.png)

## inbound firewall rules versus outbound firewall rules

Simply put, inbound firewall rules protect the network from unwanted incoming traffic from the internet or other networks -- in particular, disallowed connections, malware and DoS attacks. Outbound firewall rules control outgoing traffic -- that is, requests to resources outside of the network. For example, a connection request to an email service or the TechTarget website might be allowed, but connection requests to unapproved or dangerous websites are stopped.
