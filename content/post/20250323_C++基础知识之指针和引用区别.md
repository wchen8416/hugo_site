# pointer and lvalue reference in C++(C++中的指针和引用)

## reference:

A reference defines an alternative name for an object. A reference type “refers to” another type.  
examples:

```cpp
int ival = 1024;
int &refVal = ival; // refVal refers to (is another name for) ival
int &refVal2; // error: a reference must be initialized
```

Ordinarily, when we initialize a variable, the value of the initializer is copied into the
object we are creating. When we define a reference, **instead of copying the initializer’s
value, we bind the reference to its initializer**. Once initialized, a reference remains
bound to its initial object. There is no way to rebind a reference to refer to a different
object. **Because there is no way to rebind a reference, references must be initialized**.

A reference is not an object. Instead, a reference is just another name for an already existing object.
After a reference has been defined, all operations on that reference are actually operations on the object to which the reference is bound.
When we assign to a reference, we are assigning to the object to which the reference is bound. When we fetch the value of a reference, we are really fetching the value of the object to which the reference is bound. Similarly, when we use a reference as an initializer, we are really using the object to which the reference is bound.

Because references are not objects, we may not define a reference to a reference. a reference **may be bound only to an object**, not to a literal or to the result of a more general expression.

## pointer:

A pointer is a compound type that “points to” another type. Like references, pointers
are used for indirect access to other objects.

Unlike a reference, a pointer is an object in its own right. Pointers can be assigned and copied; a single pointer can point to several different objects over its lifetime. Unlike a reference, a pointer need not be initialized at the time it is defined. Like other built-in types, pointers defined at block scope have undefined value if they are not initialized.

## difference between reference and pointer:

引用和指针是 C++中两种重要的间接访问机制。引用实质上是一个别名，它在声明时必须初始化，一旦绑定就不能改变。引用不能为空，也不能建立引用的引用，这使得它比指针更安全。**引用在内存中实际上是作为一个常量指针实现的，但它对程序员隐藏了指针的复杂性。**

指针则是一个变量，它存储了另一个变量的内存地址。指针可以为空，可以改变它所指向的对象，也可以进行指针运算。指针的灵活性使它成为一个强大的工具，但同时也容易导致程序错误，如悬空指针和内存泄漏。

Both pointers and references give indirect access to other objects. However, there are
important differences in how they do so. **The most important is that a reference is not
an object.** Once we have defined a reference, there is no way to make that reference
refer to a different object. When we use a reference, we always get the object to
which the reference was initially bound. --- 《C++ Primer, 5th Edition, 2.3.2》
